# üì∫ New Season Soon for Kometa

Inspired by [PATTRMM](https://github.com/InsertDisc/pattrmm) this simplifed script checks your [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) for TV Shows for which a new season is airing within a chosen amount of days and creates .yml files which can be used by [Kometa](https://kometa.wiki/) to create a collection and overlays.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the script
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/netplexflix/New-Season-Soon-for-Kometa.git
cd New-Season-Soon-for-Kometa
```

![#c5f015](https://placehold.co/15x15/c5f015/c5f015.png) Or simply download by pressing the green 'Code' button above and then 'Download Zip'.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extract or move the files to a 'NSSK' subfolder in your Kometa config folder
- Go to your Kometa install folder, then config.
- Create a subfolder named NSSK.
- Put the files in this subfolder. (`config.yml`, `NSSK.py` and `requirements.txt`)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
- Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed (`>=3.8` recommended). <br/>
- Open a Terminal in the script's directory
>[!TIP]
>Windows Users: <br/>
>Go to the NSSK folder (where NSSK.py is). Right mouse click on an empty space in the folder and click `Open in Windows Terminal`
- Install the required dependencies by pasting the following code:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Edit your Kometa config
- Open your Kometa config.yml (config/config.yml, NOT config/NSSK/config.yml)
- Under your TV Show library settings, add the paths to `NSSK_TV_COLLECTION.yml` and `NSSK_TV_OVERLAYS.yml` (These files will be created in your NSSK folder when you run the script).<br/>
  Example:
  ```
  TV Shows:
    collection_files:
    - file: P:/Kometa/config/NSSK/NSSK_TV_COLLECTION.yml
    overlay_files:
    - file: P:/Kometa/config/NSSK/NSSK_TV_OVERLAYS.yml
  ```
>[!NOTE]
>If you don't want to create a collection and only overlays you can ofcourse skip adding the collection file to your Kometa config.<br/>
>Or the other way around..
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

## üöÄ Usage - Running the Script

Open a Terminal in your script directory and launch the script with:
```sh
python NSSK.py
```
The script will list matched and/or skipped shows and create the .yml files. <br/>
The previous configuration will be erased so Kometa will automatically remove overlays for shows that no longer match the criteria.

> [!TIP]
> Windows users can create a batch file to quickly launch the script.<br/>
> Type `"[path to your python.exe]" "[path to the script]" -r pause"` into a text editor
>
> For example:
> ```
>"C:\Users\User1\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\python.exe" "P:\Kometa\config\NSSK\NSSK.py" -r
>pause
> ```
> Save as a .bat file. You can now double click this batch file to directly launch the script.<br/>
> You can also use this batch file to [schedule](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-automated-task-using-task-scheduler-windows-10) the script to run.
